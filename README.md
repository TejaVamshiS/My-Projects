This repository has a collection of Python projects which I have worked on. I'll be working more to keep on adding more projects which can be easy to understand.

# About Python
Python is a well-liked, easy-to-read programming language that is strong and adaptable. It is extensively utilized in many different fields, such as automation, data science, machine learning, and web development. Python provides solutions for a variety of jobs because of its large standard library and active third-party package ecosystem.
